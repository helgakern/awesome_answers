class Question < ApplicationRecord
    # This is the Question model. We generated this
    # file with the command:
    # rails g model question title:string body:text
    # This command also generates a migration file in 
    # db/migrate

    # Rails will add att_accessors for all columns
    # of the table (i.e title, body, created_at, updated_at, ...)

    # Adding 'dependent: :destroy' option tells Rails to
    # delete associated records before deleting the record
    # itself. In this case, when a question is deleted,
    # its answers are deleted first to satisfy the foreign 
    # key constraint.
    # You can also use 'dependant: :nullify' which will
    # cause all associated answers to have their question_id
    # column set to NULL before the question is destroyed.

    # if you don't use either depandent options, you can end up
    # with answers in your db referencing question_ids
    # that no longer exist, likely leading to errors. 
    # Always set a dependent option to help maintain
    # referential integrity.

        # The & symbol is used to tell Ruby that the following argument
        # should be treated as a block givent to the method. So the line:
        # self.tags.map(&:name).join(", ")
        # is equivalent to:
        # self.tags.map { |x| x.name }.join(", ")
        # So the above will iterate over the collection self.tags
        # and build an array with the result of the name method 
        # called on every item. (We then join the array into a comma
        # separated string)

    # Appending = at the end of a method name, allows us to implement
    # a 'setter'. A setter is a method that is assignable.

    # q.tag_names = "stuff, yo"

    # The code in the example above would call the method we wrote 
    # below where the value on the right-hand side of the '=' would 
    # become the argument to the method

    # Fetch All Questions
    # questions = Question.all ðŸ‘ˆ this will give us back the list of questions as an object
    # the object behaves like an array so you can call methods on it like (.each) and you
    # can also chain it with other methods to do other types of operations and queries

    # Creating a new question
    # To create a new question object in memory do:
    # q = Question.new
    # you can also pass in a hash to the new method as in:
    # q = Question.new({ title: 'To be or not to be', body: 'is that a question?', view_count: 0 })
    # or for short:
    # q = Question.new title: 'To be or not to be }, body: 'is that a question?', view_count: 0 

    # to save the above question into questions table:
    # q.save ðŸ‘ˆ this will save that above question into the questions table (persist it)

    # Creating a record right away
    # you can create a record right away in the database using (.create) method as in:
    # Question.create({ title: 'My Question Title', body: 'My question body', view_count: 1 })

    # Fetching Records
    # .first
    # Question.first ðŸ‘ˆ fetches the first record ordered by the id in an ascending order
    # The sql equivalent:
    # SELECT "questions".* FROM "questions" ORDER BY "questions"."id" ASC LIMIT 1;

    # .last
    # Question.last ðŸ‘ˆ fetches the last record ordered by the id in an ascending order 
    # The sql equivalent:
    # SELECT "questions".* FROM "questions" ORDER BY "qeustions"."id" DESC LIMIT 1;

    # .find
    # Question.find(1) ðŸ‘ˆ finding records by their primary key which is likely id

    # .find_by_x ðŸ‘ˆ x is the column name
    # Question.find_by_title('My Last Question') ðŸ‘ˆ this finds a question with title 
    # exactly "My Last Question"

    # .where
    # Question.where({ title: 'My Last Question', body: 'The body of the question' })

    # WILDCARD SEARCHING 
    # You can perform  wildcard searching with ActiveRecord using LIKE within "where" method
    # Question.where(['title LIKE ?', '%Last%'])
    # if you are using Postgres client, you can use ILIKE for case-insensitive searching:
    # Question.where(['title ILIKE ?', '%Last%'])
    # Note that in above queries we used a syntax that used '?' to insert variable into a SQL query.
    # this is important to avoid SQL injection if the variable component is actually a user input such
    # as search term.

    # .limit
    # Question.limit(10) ðŸ‘ˆ this will give us back 10 first questions that are returned from the query

    # .order
    # Question.order(:created_at) ðŸ‘ˆ this will order the fetched records by created_at. by default is ASC and 
    # if you want them in descending order do:
    # Question.order(created_at: :DESC)


    # Chaining
    # You can chain the wher, limit, order, offset, and many others to compose
    # more sophisticated queries for example:
    # Question.where(['view_count > ?', 10]).where(['title ILIKE ?', 'a']).order(id: :DESC).limit(10).offset(10)
    # Note: offset will skip first 10 records from the above query
    # SQL equivalent:
    # SELECT "questions".* FROM "questions" WHERE (view_count > 10) AND (title ILIKE 'a') ORDER BY id DESC LIMIT 10 OFFSET 10
    # another example:
    # Question.where(['view_count < ?', 10]).where(['body ILIKE ?', '%question%']).order(id: :DESC).limit(1).offset(1)

    # UPDATE RECORDS
    # once you've selected one or more records, you have ability to update them
    # Many setting attributes:
    # q = Question.find 10
    # q.title = "Some new title"
    # q.save
    # q.view_count += 1
    # q.save

    # using .update_attributes or .update
    # q = Question.find 10
    # q.update({ title: 'Updated Title', body: 'Updated body' }) or
    # q.update_attribute(:title, 'Updated Title') or
    # q.update_attributes(title: 'Updated Title', body: 'Updated body')

    # DELETING RECORDS
    # using .destroy
    # q = Question.find 10
    # q.destroy
    
    # using .delete
    # q = Question.find 10
    # q.delete

    # using .delete skips executing callback methods after_destroy and before_destroy 
    # and also skips deleting or nullifying associated records in the :dependant option
    # with associtations. Generally, avoid using ".delete" in favor of ".destroy". there are
    # only few cases when you want to use ".delete"

    # Aggregate functions
    # .count
    # Question.count ðŸ‘ˆ counts the number of records in questions model
    # SQL equivalent:
    # SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "questions";

    # .groud
    # Question.select('avg(view_count) as count').group('view_count')


    # 5 questions with same title => it will add their view_counts / 5 and it will return it as count = result

    # CALLING RAW QUERIES
    # connection = ActiveRecord::Base.connection
    # result = connection.execute('SELECT * FROM questions WHERE id=1;')
    # result.first ðŸ‘ˆ because the result is an array of hashes

    # Exercise: Question Contains
    # Build a query that fetches the first 10 questions
    # that contain "el" in their titles ordered by "created_at"
    # in a descending order
    # solution:
    # Question.where(['title LIKE ?', '%el%']).limit(10)

    # Exercise: First 10 Questions
    # Build a query that fetches the first 10 most viewed questions
    # that were created in the last three days
    # Solution:
    # Question.where('created_at >= ?', 3.days.ago).order(view_count: :DESC).limit(10)
end
