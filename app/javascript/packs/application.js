// This file is automatically compiled by Webpack, along with any other files

// Rails webpacker is a gem which wraps webpack, the popular JavaScript tool that is used
// for managin and bundling JavaScript code, and provides helpers to use the webpack in
// our rails application

// This file is the point for webpack, which means webpack first look in this file.
// So, the 'application' pack is the entry point ofr all of our JavaScript ode.
// We can create custom packs and place them in the app/javascript/packs directory
// and webpacker will find them easily while compiling. and this setting is
// configured in `config/webpacker.yml`.

// Rails frameworks which have JavaScript component such as Rails-UJS,
// Turbolinks, ActiveStorage are migrated to support webpacker
